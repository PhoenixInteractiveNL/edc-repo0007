v0.06b -> v0.07b
****************

Added support for Zilmar's graphics plugin spec.
Fixed OS-HLE bugs that stopped several roms working in v0.06b.
Texture perspective correction is now always enabled (Morloc)
Added internal screenshot capability (press F12 to get a png of the current frame in
   the dumps directory) (doesn't work with graphics plugins).
Added 1024 x 768 display resolution.
Added status bar (for checking FPS/VIs without debug console). Only works with
   graphics plugins (as internal graphics code covers status bar).
Optimised RDRAM read/writes.
Optimised dynarec reads.
Added multiple directory support: Daedalus will recurse through the specified directory
   structure looking for roms.
Added save game folder selection.
Added support for .jap, .pal and .usa extensions on roms.
