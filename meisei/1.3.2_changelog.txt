1.3.2

It's been nearly a year since the last update, coding time was mostly spent on another project, and MAME. meisei hasn't stood still though; whenever I noticed a small glitch or annoyance, it was fixed rightaway. This accumulation of minor fixes and improvements makes it worthwile to do an intermediate release, so here we go, version++.
