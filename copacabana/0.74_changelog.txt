Changes - 12th April 2006
-------------------------

VERSION 0.74
------------
Windows specific:
  New Sound menu that includes the ability to "record" sound to an AY file in text format.
    I'm separately providing AY tools: AYPlay and AYCompress to work with these files.
    AYPlay allows to replay an AY file or to create a wav file from it.
    AYCompress generates a compressed binary AY file that AYPlay is also able to play.
