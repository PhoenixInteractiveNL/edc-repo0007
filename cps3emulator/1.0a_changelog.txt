Changes - 15th July 2007
------------------------

v1.0a

Fixed CHD reading for the Alt Versions
Fixed Jojoalt rom 10 CRC, it was loading the one from the parent jojo set.
Fixed crashing in sfiii3 when Ken finishes Makoto with neutral throw (kicks). It's
actually a bug in the game (fixed in sfiii3a). In the real board it would cause an address
error (misaligned jump) and would reset the machine due to watchdog. In the emu it will just
freeze the game because there is not watchdog, just hit F3 to restart the game.
Fixed Jojo games damage level. It was a core bug in the ADDC (add with carry) opcode, so it
could be causing problems in other games too.
Added support for joypads with more than 8 buttons.
Re-enabled the Unload Rom button, I disabled it because it fails more times than works, but
there is some people that actually used it, so I've enabled it again.
