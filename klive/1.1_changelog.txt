What's New in Klive v1.1 ?
--------------------------

Basically, I altered/added a few things that have been requested by various people:

* Altered Menus - in the default window size, they did not fit on one line under any OS except XP.
  Most options now moved into a seperate OPTIONS menu.

* Added (...) to some menu options, as requested.

* New Joystick Configuration Dialog. Now you can select any DirectInput device to be used with
  either player.

* Added PC Keyboard (Cursor Keys + Left CTRL key) as a Joystick Emulation Option.

* Added the ability to Pause the emulation.

* Added the ability to Mute the Sound emulation.

* Altered/Improved timing, especially on the Spectrum 128 and +2 machines.

* Added File History. The last 8 files loaded are stored here for quick access.

* Added basic Command Line support. You can now launch Klive with:
  KLIVE filename [-fullscreen]
  If the -fullscreen option is added, Klive will jump to full screen mode, and the ESC key will
  exit Klive immediately.

* Added WAV file support. You can now load tapes from WAV files. They can be 8 or 16 bit, but must
  be MONO.

* Added Real Tape Mode. You can now load games from real Spectrum tapes, through your sound card.

* Added TV Mode. When in FullScreen, Klive can now be set to emulate the display of a real TV.

* Added the ability to force Software Scaling when in Windowed mode. Some people, apparently, do
  not like the filtering applied by most video cards when using Hardware Scaling. Note: this mode
  WILL be quite a bit slower than Hardware Scaling.

* Added another size setting to the Window Selection: When Software Scaling is selected, scaling
  is only done for 1x, 2x, 3x and 4x, because any sub-pixel sizes would have defeated the object
  of putting this option in... therefore, a suitable size for 3x had to be added.
